The Text to 3D application employs the Stable Diffusion algorithm utilizing the "ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning" model in conjunction with open3d and the DepthEstimation model to convert textual input into a three-dimensional model.

To utilize this functionality, simply download and open the provided Kaggle Notebook.

For users employing alternative notebooks, please ensure to update the output directory for the Stable Diffusion output and the input directory for the open3d model accordingly.

To visualize the resulting 3d model, download the output.ply file and open it using any compatible 3D model viewer.
